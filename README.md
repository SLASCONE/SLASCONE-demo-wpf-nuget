# SLASCONE-demo-wpf-nuget
A demo client application (WPF) for SLASCONE software licensing, which uses the official NuGet package. Its main purpose is to demonstrate how you can enable online and/or offline licensing (at the same time), while providing a rudimentary/explanatory UI. Although this is a desktop application, the same principles apply for other types of applications too. Depending on your scenario you might need:

- both online and offline mode
- online mode only
- offline mode only

## ONLINE ACTIVATION


## OFFLINE ACTIVATION
